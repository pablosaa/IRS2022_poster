%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The study focuses on the Western Arctic to address the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item How are macro- and microphysical cloud properties influenced by the presence of leads or polynyas?
	\item Are cloud radiative effects different during different sea ice conditions?
	\item In which way does the coupling/decoupling of clouds to moisture-layer impact the cloud's properties?
\end{itemize}

Daily sea ice concentration (SIC) is primarily obtained from satellite retrievals provided by the University of Bremen [1], the following analysis is performed to couple sea ice conditions with cloud observations above NSA:

\colouredcircle SIC AMSR2 products is analyzed for a sector 50~km around the NSA site (red star in Fig.~\ref{fig:sic_wind}).\\

	\label{fig:sic_wind}
\end{minipage}

\colouredcircle Sea ice - atmosphere coupling conceptual model\\
Gradient of water vapour transport ($\nabla_z WVT$) is calculated from humidity and radiosonde wind profiles. The direction of maximum transport (see grey lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:sic_wind}) is used to relate SIC with zenith observations at NSA.

	\caption{\small Schematic for sea ice interaction with observed clouds.}
	\label{fig:leadcloud}
\end{minipage}

The virtual potential temperature $\theta_v$ is analyzed to classify cases where the WVT is coupled or decoupled to the cloud.

\end{minipage}


\colouredcircle Skin temperature is estimated considering SIC values:
\begin{equation}
	T_{skin}(sic, T_s) = SST - SIC\times(SST~-~T_s)
	\label{eq:Tskin}
\end{equation}
with $SST$ being sea surface temperature (assumed as 271.34~K), SIC from $0\dots1$, and $T_s$ the surface temperature derived from observations as:
\[
	T_s = \Big[ \frac{F_{lw}^{\downarrow} - (1-\varepsilon_s)F_{lw}^{\uparrow}}{\varepsilon_s~\sigma} \Big]^{\frac{1}{4}}
\]
being $F_{lw}^{\downarrow}$ and $F_{lw}^{\uparrow}$ down- and up-welling measured LW fluxes~[\ref{bib:thakur2022}, \ref{bib:ebell2020}]. The surface LW emissivity $\varepsilon_s$ is assumed 0.981$\pm$5\% to cover characteristic NSA winter values~[\ref{bib:shupe2015}, \ref{bib:dolinar2016}].
\begin{equation}
	\Delta T~=~T_{skin}(sic, T_s)~-~T_{2m}
	\label{eq:deltaT}
\end{equation}
Here $\Delta T$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:deltaT} is used as proxy for SIC dependent sensible heat flux between the interface sea ice surface-atmosphere. %Results are sorted by the cloud-sea ice coupled/decoupled conditions. Statistics of LW net surface radiation and cloud radiative effects (CRE) are shown as a function of cloud water content and SIC.

CRE is calculated based on cloudy observations and corresponding clear-sky simulations following [\ref{bib:bruts1975}] and [\ref{bib:long2008}] for longwave downwelling radiation. Clear sky calculation is a state-of-the-art value added product from ARM~[\ref{bib:riihimaki2019}].

\headerbox{4.- Conclusions}{name=conclutions,column=1,span=2,below=results}{
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{Ground-based radiation observations at the ARM site at the North Slope of Alaska (NSA) have been analyzed for the period of winters 2012 to 2020. The data has been classified into sea ice - cloud coupled/ decoupled cases. The results are consistent with previous findings regarding the effect of low sea ice concentration (e.g., due to the presence of leads or polynyas) on cloud micro- and macro-physical properties. Cloud properties like liquid and ice water path (LWP and IWP), cloud base height, and cloud geometrical thickness are also variables strongly influencing the surface radiation budget. Our results depict that a warming cloud effect on the surface is clearly enhanced by atmospheric thermodynamic and dynamic conditions which are coupled with the sea ice situation downwind.

So far only simulation of clear-sky for longwave downwelling radiation have been considered, in the future we will include complete clear-sky simulations following~[\ref{bib:ebell2020}] for the central Arctic site Ny~Alesund, thus a better picture on CRE will be achieved.
